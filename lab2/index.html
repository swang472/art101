			<h1>Lab 2: HTML and CSS Starter</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is Angela Wang, I'm currently a sophmore at UC Santa 
			Cruz studying design. I'm originally from Hsinchu City, Taiwan and I moved 
			to Cupertino, California at the age of ten. I have a pet dog named Pluto, and 
			he is a shih tzu.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out 
					the font and color of the website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have any significant problems, and I just
					played around with the font size and color of the website
					until I liked what I had. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment wasn't that difficult, and it
					was interesting to see the final results of my website.</p>
